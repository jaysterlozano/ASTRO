# ASTRO
Final project entitled: "ASTRO" 

**********Bugs
Figured out how to not automatically get onto on the platform even just hitting the bottom of it. 
But sometimes every now and then it happens when you can get onto the platform by hitting the bottom of it.
When you hit the enemies side you still get a boost, but most of the time you die when you hit the side.
The game lags from here and there if you hold down the space bar too long, instead of not hitting it very quickly 


**********Features
Based this version of the game off of Travis Scott's Album "AstroWorld"
Had the background of the album cover, and the background music was from the song Yosemite
Had the jump music sound like squeals that relate to parts of songs in this album 
Starting to add powerups and change the direction the enemies are going 
Changed the platforms, and character so that when you jumped it swtiched colors from brown to purple 
have the enemies falling horizontally, with the spike on top of the enemies head
Hit the spike and get a boost 
Changed the background colors and the font color
Changed the transparency 
Raised the frequency of the enemies so there are more falling, and 
instead of getting stuck there was more of a risk/reward factor on trying to jump on the enemy to get a boost

*****Personal Note
I really enjoyed this class. At first, I was nervous that I would not know a lot considering I was way out of my comfort zone. 
I started out not knowing anything, but I really learned a lot over the time in this semester. You made the class fun and enjoyable 
with all of the projects I did. I did struggle at some points during this semester especially on this project. I would get frustrated
over a part of code or even one line, but with the help of you, my peers, and the internet, I was able to figure out most of my problems,
but this always posed a challenge for me. I just wanted to give a quick thank you to Shub and Jacob that were always there to help me. 
Thank you Mr. Cozort for making this class fun, challenging, and enjoyable.
